# AI-Driven-Loan-Analytics-for-Credit-Risk-and-Borrower-Insights
To leverage data analytics and machine learning to explore borrower behaviors, predict loan amount, loan interest using some features characteristics, and build credit risk scoring systems that aid financial institutions in optimizing loan approval, pricing, and risk assessment processes.

Objectives

1.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Insights
  o	Analyze income levels vs loan amounts to understand how borrower income influences borrowing patterns.
  o	Explore the credit score distribution and its relationship with loan defaults.
  o	Study the effect of employment experience on loan approvals and interest rates.

3.	Regression Tasks
  o	Develop machine learning models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks) to predict loan interest rates or loan amounts based on borrower features.
  o	Optimize loan pricing and lending limits using predictive analytics.

4.	Feature Importance Analysis
  o	Identify key factors influencing loan decisions, such as income, credit score, and employment history.
  o	Use feature importance tools like Random Forest Importance, SHAP, and LIME to analyze variable impact.
  o	Visualize and interpret the impact of critical features on model predictions.

**AI-Driven Loan Analytics for Credit Risk and Borrower Insights**

* **Problem:** Financial institutions face challenges in identifying high-risk borrowers and improving loan approval strategies.
* **Action:** Designed and implemented a machine learning model using financial and demographic data to assess credit risk and borrower behavior.

  * Built classification models to predict loan default risk and segment borrowers based on behavioral and financial attributes.
  * Conducted data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key risk indicators.
  * Created an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize loan data, highlight trends, and support financial decision-making.
* **Result:** Helped uncover insights to improve underwriting decisions, reduce default rates, and align strategies with credit risk management policies.

To leverage data analytics and machine learning to explore borrower behaviors, predict loan amount, loan interest using some features characteristics, and build credit risk scoring systems that aid financial institutions in optimizing loan approval, pricing, and risk assessment processes.

Objectives

1.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Insights
  o	Analyze income levels vs loan amounts to understand how borrower income influences borrowing patterns.
  o	Explore the credit score distribution and its relationship with loan defaults.
  o	Study the effect of employment experience on loan approvals and interest rates.

3.	Regression Tasks
  o	Develop machine learning models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks) to predict loan interest rates or loan amounts based on borrower features.
  o	Optimize loan pricing and lending limits using predictive analytics.

4.	Feature Importance Analysis
  o	Identify key factors influencing loan decisions, such as income, credit score, and employment history.
  o	Use feature importance tools like Random Forest Importance, SHAP, and LIME to analyze variable impact.
  o	Visualize and interpret the impact of critical features on model predictions.
